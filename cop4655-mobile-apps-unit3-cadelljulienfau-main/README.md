# Project 3 - *Flixster*

Submitted by: **Cadell Julien**

**Flixster** is an app that introduces networking and api. Which allows us to see movies from an acutal databse. This app includes a poseter where one will be able to view only. From the build up of last time it is a browsing app that allows one to chose and pick a movie. One a movie is clicked on they'll be redirected to another screen where it gives more info on the app.

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

## Notes

Building the app was fairly simple. What wasn't simple was having the image load. I kept getting erros on how I could couldn't connect a url to a string and vice versa. Then I went with a string route by changing the url to a string and then connecting it which worked out fine.
